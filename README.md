# Timeless Roleplaying Utilities
by the name, i think you'd know what this script is about.
these are... utilities, meant to be executed in Roblox roleplaying games.
it's somewhat cluttered, but it's flexible.
> [!WARNING]
> this script works best in games that don't mess with your rig
> also execute it in a Synapse X-esque environment—like KRNL. make sure getsynasset and a workspace folder is present—it should be created automatically

> [!CAUTION]
> please don't use this script to gain an unfair advantage in actual games.
> if you will, it's not like i can stop you, but if you get banned, don't come crying to me about it. it's your choice.

# Code
load the script by configuring and executing [this code](https://github.com/relojac/TimelessRPUtils/blob/main/EXECUTEME.lua).

you can also delete every Timeless asset from your workspace folder if you've downloaded them by executing [this code](https://github.com/relojac/TimelessRPUtils/blob/main/EXECUTEME.lua).

- [Naming Standard](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard/tree/main) by ScriptUNC/Unified Naming Convention - a well documented API for Roblox executors. genuinely learned a lot from here (and it's so POWERFUL..!!)
