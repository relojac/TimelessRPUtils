hello, i'm - oh wait i'm still in lowercase

# Timeless License
Hello, as you know, I coded and debugged over 500 lines just for 5 buttons, so I'd greatly appreciate if you didn't steal my work.

Don't get me wrong, you can still use my work in a lot of cases. But if you feel it's morally right, you can contact me here: relojac00057@gmail.com

I don't obfuscate my scripts, because in most cases, that really degrades the performance; *Especially on low end devices.* I generally wish to make this script as stable as possible on every device.

# Dos and Don'ts
## Dos
You may:
- Contribute to this script through pull requests and bug reports/suggestions.
- Use the *Main library* for your own scripts. (You will need to credit me.)
- Learn **Luau** through my script.
- Fork this repository. 

## Don'ts
You may not:
- Steal this script (aka. **Skidding**) or use this script without crediting me. This includes selling it or distributing it under your name.
